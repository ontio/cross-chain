## Contributions

Please open a pull request with a signed commit. We appreciate your help! You can also send your code as email to the developer mailing list. You're welcome to join the Ontology mailing list or developer forum.

Please provide a detailed submission information when you want to contribute code for this project. The format is as follows:

Header line: Explain the commit in one line (use the imperative).

Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue being fixed, etc.

The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs. Please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than 74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things  nicely even when it is indented.

Make sure you explain your solution and why you are doing what you are doing, as opposed to describing what you are doing. Reviewers and your future self can read the patch, but might not understand why a particular solution was implemented.
